Is to give you an opportunity to better understand the specific SDLC activities supported by each. So today we have Janice to walk us through privacy by design, what that does mean within the SDLC, what's expected from teams.

Because if I so just to make sure I understand what my local health care organization may use IMR to process my medical records in order to be able to easily file them and collect that information, structure that data about me, right?
Janis Williams 36 minutes 55 seconds
But if I left my local hospital and said, hey, I'm I'm going to move my care to another location, I want to affect my right and I would like you to delete the data that you have on me.
Janis Williams 37 minutes 10 seconds
Yes, there are components of that data that's been processed through that application that would need to be deleted or be put in a portable fashion. So then I could take my data from my, you know, healthcare provider A to healthcare provider B so that it can be imported into their system.
Janis Williams 37 minutes 30 seconds
With Ease and I don't have to be the middle person trying to get my records updated with health care provider B. But there are some components of the data that's collected within the applications where health care provider A.
Janis Williams 37 minutes 46 seconds
That data that's been collected about that individual that wasn't directly provided by the individual, maybe it's for audit logging, right? That data doesn't have to be deleted from the system because that's applicable to the organization being able to run their business like they need to be able to collect some of that.
Janis Williams 38 minutes 4 seconds
But anything in regards to the medical records and the the healthcare data collected that wouldn't need to be.
Janis Williams 38 minutes 11 seconds
Able to be deleted, rectified, portability, limited processing. The data subject rights would apply to that data.
