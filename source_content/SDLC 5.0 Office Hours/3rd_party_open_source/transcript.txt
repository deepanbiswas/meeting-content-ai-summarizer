Just waiting for OK, recording in progress. So welcome everyone. Thanks for joining 
COE Office Hours session. We're glad to have you here. This is like a great 
opportunity to better understand specific SDLC activities. Today we're going to 
have third party open source SDLC office hours.

We've got Brent and John with us as our series. I don't know if you guys have a 
presentation or you're just gonna walk us through your activities. Feel free, 
whatever you have in mind. And with that, I think I will just hand it over to 
to you guys for the next 50.

Go ahead, Brent, you can, you can, you can go ahead and get started. I'm so both 
of us are coming out of other meetings right now. So I'm trying to realign myself 
here real quick. We don't want to talk about vulnerability remediation for CIC 
products right now, which is my last discussion.

I think this is what we're talking about open source, right? We're trying to look at open source and other.

Brent Beard 1 minute 14 seconds
Um.
Brent Beard 1 minute 16 seconds
Yeah, I can't talk about legal.4 for 15 minutes, let alone 50. But all right, so the point of the legal.4 activity in the SDLC is to ensure that we are complying with.
Brent Beard 1 minute 32 seconds
License terms for any software projects that we are including within our own products and so generally I would consider those either to be proprietary licenses so that licenses we are.
Brent Beard 1 minute 49 seconds
Usually purchasing from another company and then the second bucket I would put 
open source licenses. I think everyone here is familiar with open source 
licensing. What that means to product teams is that for again for that first 
bucket, the proprietary.

Brent Beard 2 minutes 8 seconds
Licenses. If you are going to be making a purchase, you're going to require you 
to submit a sourcing request to. As part of that, that sourcing request, if 
necessary, will create a contract request and the legal team will review the 
license terms with respect to that purchase.

Brent Beard 2 minutes 25 seconds
As part of that, and then if there are certain things that we need to do outside 
of what we typically do, that will be identified by the legal team. At that 
point, it'll be communicated to you and then it'll be your responsibility to 
implementing them if necessary.
Brent Beard 2 minutes 44 seconds
I think an example of this is our Workday integration. It is when we were 
building our Workday integration for CIC, Workday sent us their new built on 
Workday program or built on Workday agreements. That agreement included language 
that said, hey, you have to include these terms.

Brent Beard 3 minutes 4 seconds
In all of your contracts with customers, so legal identified that. In this case, 
legal was able to handle that ourselves. We put that in our contract templates. 
There may be situations where these third party vendors say, hey, you need to 
include us in attribution notice or you need to do this.

Brent Beard 3 minutes 21 seconds
In your software, again, that'll be all identified via the contract request for 
these proprietary software licenses. And so when you get to legal dot four, you 
say, hey, did I submit any sourcing requests for this? Yes. Did legal tell me to 
do anything? Yes. Am I doing it? Yes. That's the.

Brent Beard 3 minutes 38 seconds
The check that I would expect people to be doing for open source.
Brent Beard 3 minutes 44 seconds
Um.

Karolina Walczynska
36 minutes 51 seconds36:51
Karolina Walczynska 36 minutes 51 seconds
OK. Any other questions?
Karolina Walczynska 36 minutes 59 seconds
If not, I guess we can wrap up this session. Thanks so much Brandon, John, for 
sharing your time and insights today, answering all the questions, explaining 
your area. Thanks for great questions, great session. I'm just posting on the 
chat.

Karolina Walczynska 37 minutes 19 seconds
Where I'm going to place recording this is a that that's going to be available 
on Teams chat. There's a channel for our COE to to answer some of the questions 
that's going to be checked by SDLC team to all of the recordings and chat links 
are also available. Second link that's posted there.

Karolina Walczynska 37 minutes 39 seconds
